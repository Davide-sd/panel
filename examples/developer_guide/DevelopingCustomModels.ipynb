    "# Developing Custom Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel ships with a number of custom Bokeh models, which have both Python and Javascript components. When developing Panel these custom models have to be compiled. This happens automatically with `pip install -e .` or `python setup.py develop`, however when runnning actively developing you can rebuild the extension with `panel build panel`. The build command is just an alias for `bokeh build`; see the [Bokeh developer guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide/setup.html) for more information about developing bokeh models or the [Awesome Panel - Bokeh Extensions Guide](https://awesome-panel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/awesome-panel-extensions-guide/bokeh-extensions.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other Javascript (or Typescript) library Panel defines a `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. When adding, updating or removing a dependency in the `package.json` file ensure you commit the changes to the `package-lock.json` after running npm install."
